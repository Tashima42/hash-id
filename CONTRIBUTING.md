# Contributing
Thank you for being interested in contributing to this project!
The scope of changes is really narrow due to the nature of this application, it's meant to be as simple as possible, keep this in mind.

## Development
Maintaining the simplicity principle in mind, this is a standard *rust book-like* project, this means that It has very few dependencies and the setup is the exactly the same as the  example projects in the book.

## What can you do
I'm currently looking for package maintainers, if you have any experience with this, please contribute.
* Arch (AUR) package: My current attempt at making a `PKGBUILD` failed, and [this package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hash-id/) doesn't work.

You can also:
* Translate this documentation to your language
* Improve error handling
* Refactor code (PRs are always welcome)
